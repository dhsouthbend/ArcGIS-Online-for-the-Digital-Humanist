# Part 7: Data Preparation

For the remainder of the workshop, you are going to learn how to use four different tools in ArcGIS Online (filters, overlay layers, extract data, and table joins) to examine historical changes in the population of Indiana between 1940 and 1950.

Before getting started, upload the following feature classes and tables into ArcGIS Online, available for download [here](/Data):

1. State Boundaries.shp
2. 1940_US_Counties.shp
3. 1950_US_Counties.shp
4. 1960_US_County_Population.shp
5. 1940 US County Population.csv
6. 1950 US County Population.csv

Note: You will need to instruct ArcGIS Online on how you want to import the csv files for this part of the workshop because csv files can be used to create feature layers with point geometry. **All csv files for this workshop are intended to be used as tables.** To import each csv as a table, select the following option during the location settings configuration step of the new item creation process in the content tab.
