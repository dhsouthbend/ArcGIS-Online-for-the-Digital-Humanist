# Part 2: Getting to Know ArcGIS Online

Now that we have covered some of the key terms and concepts in GIS, it's time to familiarize yourself with ArcGIS Online, ESRI's web-based version of the ArcGIS platform.

[ArcGIS Online](https://www.arcgis.com) is a powerful, browser-based GIS platform that offers users access to a GIS workspace, space for file storage, and tools to collaborate with other individuals who use ArcGIS Online.

### Step 1: Log In

To start working in ArcGIS Online, head to the sign-in page at [https://www.arcgis.com](https://www.arcgis.com).

</p>

At the sign-in page, you'll need to log on with the organizational login assigned to you by your system administrator. **For ND users, your username is your own version of netid_NotreDame. Just substitute your netid into the template.** If you do not have an organizational login, you can create a free account which will give you access to a limited number of features on ArcGIS Online or a 21-day trial account that will give you access to all of the tools in ArcGIS Online and a limited number of tool credits for the duration of the trial period.

### Step 2: Explore the Content Tab

Before we start working with spatial data in ArcGIS Online, we are going to take a look at ArcGIS Online's file storage system: [the content tab](https://www.arcgis.com/home/content.html).

The content tab is a space where you can manage your existing files, upload files to use in ArcGIS Online and other web applications managed by ESRI, and control sharing permissions for your data.

To navigate to your content, click on the content tab in the ribbon at the top of the ArcGIS Online webpage.

Then, take a minute to familiarize yourself with the various options in the content tab using the infographic below.

### Step 3: Explore the Map Viewer

After poking around in the content tab, navigate to the Map Viewer by clicking on the map tab in the ribbion at the top of the ArcGIS Online webpage. Take a moment to explore the map viewer. If you are curious about any of the buttons located on either side of the map viewr, consult this [infographic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacobmswisher/ArcGIS-Online-for-the-Digital-Humanist/0b060eee85ccd131207711f127276037e5eed56e/Sections/Images/Figure%207.jpg?token=GHSAT0AAAAAACE7LA536HVY2ECDKOTSSKX6ZFWSKKA).

**Note: If you end up in map viewer classic, click the Open in Map Viewer button in the top right corner of your browser to switch to the new Map Viewer.**
