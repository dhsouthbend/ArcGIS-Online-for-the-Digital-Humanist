# Part 11: Data Analysis

Congratulations! You have successfully created feature layers representing the historical population in Indiana counties during 1940 and 1950.

> ### Exercise 10: Identify Patterns in WWII-Era Population Growth in Indiana
> 
> Using the skills you have developed in this workshop so far, take a few minutes to explore your datasets. Can you discern any patterns in Indiana's population growth from the World War II Era?

<p>&nbsp;</p>

*Hint 1: Adjusting the symbology of a feature layer is an excellent way to explore your data. Try enabling the counts and amounts setting to create a visualization that allows you to explore population growth across the state.*

*Hint 2: If you want to compare statewide population numbers between 1940 and 1950, try using the attribute table. By clicking on the three dot button on a field in the attribute table, you can access information for that field. Fields that store numbers will give you access to summary statistics for the information stored in that field for all records (including filtered records) in the attribute table.*
